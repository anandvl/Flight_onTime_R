# Flight_onTime_R
Experiment with setting up R-script (in Rstudio) and RShiny app to be executed on mybinder.org

Following the [binder examples](https://github.com/binder-examples/r) to run a R script (in RStudio) and a shiny-app using mybinder, I have set up a script to plot statistics on departure and arrival delays and taxi times of all flights in and out of US airports in Jan 2018.  User selects the airport and the script displays a box plot for all these 4 cases for all the airlines that constituted the top 95% if the flights during the month for that airport.

[Run script in RStudio](http://mybinder.org/v2/gh/anandvl/Flight_onTime_R/master?urlpath=rstudio) (Flight_onTime.R)

[Run shiny app](http://mybinder.org/v2/gh/anandvl/Flight_onTime_R/master?urlpath=shiny/shiny/Flight_onTime/)

Will later add a Jupyter notebook to run the script.
